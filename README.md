# Human vs AI Text Detector

A simple machine learning project that predicts whether a piece of text is written by a human or generated by AI.

## Problem

With the rise of large language models, identifying AI-generated content has become an important research challenge.

This project explores a basic NLP pipeline to classify text.

## Technologies

Python  
Pandas  
Scikit-learn  
TF-IDF Vectorization

## How it works

1. Text data is collected and labeled
2. TF-IDF converts text into numerical features
3. Logistic Regression learns patterns
4. The model predicts Human vs AI text

## Example

Input  
AI systems are rapidly improving every year

Output  
AI-generated

## Run the project

pip install -r requirements.txt  
python detector.py

## Future improvements

• Larger dataset  
• Deep learning models  
• Better feature engineering
