# Human vs AI Text Detector (Machine Learning Project)

A machine learning project that classifies whether a piece of text is written by a human or generated by AI.

## Overview

With the rapid rise of large language models, identifying AI-generated text has become an interesting research problem.  
This project explores a simple machine learning approach to detect such differences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing

## How It Works

1. Text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF.
2. A Logistic Regression model is trained on the dataset.
3. The model predicts whether new text is human-written or AI-generated.

## Example

Input:

AI systems are rapidly improving every year

Output:

AI-generated

## Future Improvements

- Use larger real-world datasets
- Try advanced models
- Improve feature engineering
