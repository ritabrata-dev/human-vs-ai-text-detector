# Human vs AI Text Detector

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a piece of text was written by a human or generated by AI.

## Goal

With the rise of large language models, distinguishing AI-generated text from human writing has become an important research problem.  
This project explores machine learning approaches for detecting such differences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Natural Language Processing

## Project Status

Work in progress.

## Planned Steps

- Collect dataset of human and AI text
- Clean and preprocess text
- Extract features
- Train classification model
- Evaluate results
